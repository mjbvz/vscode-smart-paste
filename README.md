# VS Code smart paste

Uses AI to smartly paste text. Some use cases:

- Translate code across programming languages.
- Adapt pasted code to match a file's formatting/naming conventions.
- Fix up small syntax or semantic errors in the pasted code.

> **❗️Important**: This extension has not been published to the marketplace as it depends on the VS Code document paste API proposal.

## Usage
Requires installing Copilot and having an active Copilot account.

With this extension installed, a `smart paste` option should show in the paste widget. Select this option to paste with AI instead of default text paste.

You can also use the `Smart Paste` command to explicitly trigger smart pasting.
